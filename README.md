# CollisionDetection
Program created during a university course in 2014.

This program checks if collision occured between 2d objects, consisting of any number of circles, triangles and rectangles, by checking if any shape, that is a part of first object, collides with any shape that is a part of second object.  Algorithm checking for collisions where one of the shapes is a polygon is based on Separating Axis Theorem. Free form polygons are not supported becasue collision detection for concave polygons would not be guaranteed to work correctly.
